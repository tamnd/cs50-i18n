# Sort - CS50x 2026

# Sort

## Problem to Solve

Recall from lecture that we saw a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.

- Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
- Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
- Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

In this problem, you’ll analyze three (compiled!) sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use. In a file called `answers.txt` in a folder called `sort`, record your answers, along with an explanation for each program, by filling in the blanks marked `TODO`.

## Distribution Code

For this problem, you’ll need some “distribution code”—that is, code written by CS50’s staff. Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`, as well as several `.txt` files for input and another file, `answers.txt`, in which to write your answers. Each of `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3` implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!). Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file. Start by downloading these files.

Download distribution files

Open [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/).

Start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute `cd` by itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.

```
$
```

Click inside of that terminal window and then execute

```
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2026/x/psets/3/sort.zip
```

followed by Enter in order to download a ZIP called `sort.zip` in your codespace. Take care not to overlook the space between `wget` and the following URL, or any other character for that matter!

Now execute

```
unzip sort.zip
```

to create a folder called `sort`. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

```
rm sort.zip
```

and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

## Hints

Explore the `.txt` files

- Multiple `.txt` files are provided to you. These files contain `n` lines of values, either reversed, shuffled, or sorted.
  
  - For example, `reversed10000.txt` contains 10,000 lines of numbers that are reversed from `10000`, while `random50000.txt` contains 50,000 lines of numbers that are in random order.
- The different types of `.txt` files may help you determine which sort is which. Consider how each algorithm performs with an already sorted list. How about a reversed list? Or shuffled list? It may help to work through a smaller list of each type and walk through each sorting process.

Time each sort with different inputs

- To run the sorts on the text files, in the terminal, run `./[program_name] [text_file.txt]`. Make sure you have made use of `cd` to move into the `sort` directory!
  
  - For example, to sort `reversed10000.txt` with `sort1`, run `./sort1 reversed10000.txt`.
- You may find it helpful to time your sorts. To do so, run `time ./[sort_file] [text_file.txt]`.
  
  - For example, you could run `time ./sort1 reversed10000.txt` to run `sort1` on 10,000 reversed numbers. At the end of your terminal’s output, you can look at the `real` time to see how much time actually elapsed while running the program.
