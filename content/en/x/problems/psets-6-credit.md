## Problem to Solve

In a filed called `credit.py` in a folder called `sentimental-credit`, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via `print`) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 1](../../1/). Your program this time should be written in Python!

## Demo

## Specification

- So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be `AMEX\n` or `MASTERCARD\n` or `VISA\n` or `INVALID\n`, nothing more, nothing less.
- For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
- Best to use `get_int` or `get_string` from CS50’s library to get users’ input, depending on how you to decide to implement this one.

## Hints

- It’s possible to use regular expressions to validate user input. You might use Python’s [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module, for example, to check whether the user’s input is indeed a sequence of digits of the correct length.

## How to Test

While `check50` is available for this problem, you’re encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `378282246310005` and press enter. Your program should output `AMEX`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `371449635398431` and press enter. Your program should output `AMEX`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `5555555555554444` and press enter. Your program should output `MASTERCARD`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `5105105105105100` and press enter. Your program should output `MASTERCARD`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `4111111111111111` and press enter. Your program should output `VISA`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `4012888888881881` and press enter. Your program should output `VISA`.
- Run your program as `python credit.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `1234567890` and press enter. Your program should output `INVALID`.
